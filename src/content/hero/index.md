I'm a software developer based in the Nashville, TN area.  My desire is to artfully weave code in order to elegantly and efficiently solve complex and challenging problems, no matter
the domain.

I'm currently searching for roles that will stretch and expand by skillset by providing mentorship opportunities and exposure to new and current technologies.
