I'm a software developer based in the Nashville, TN area.  My passion is to artfully weave code in order to elegantly and efficiently solve complex and challenging problems, no matter
the domain.

I am currently searching for roles that will provide mentorship pportunities and exposure to new and current technologies in order to stretch and expand my skill set.
