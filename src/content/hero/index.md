I'm a software developer based in the Nashville, TN area.  My desire is to artfully weave code in order to elegantly and efficiently solve complex and challenging problems, no matter
the domain.

I'm currently searching for roles that will provide mentorship opportunities and exposure to new and current technologies in order to stretch and expand my skill set.
